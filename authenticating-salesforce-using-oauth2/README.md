# Authenticating Salesforce using OAuth2 #

This example shows you how to connect to Salesforce using OAuth as the security protocol 

### Connect with Salesforce ###

At times, you may find that you need to connect one or more of your organization's on-premises systems with a SaaS such as Salesforce. Ideally, these independent systems would talk to each other and share data to enable automation of end-to-end business processes. Use Mule applications to facilitate communication between your on-prem system(s) and Salesforce. (Though this use case does not extend as far, you can also use Mule to facilitate communication between SaaS providers).

### Assumptions ###

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule and the [Anypoint™ Studio interface](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Anypoint+Studio+Essentials). To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more [Anypoint Studio Tutorials](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Basic+Studio+Tutorial). Further, this example assumes that you have a basic understanding of [Mule flows](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Mule+Application+Architecture) and [Mule Global Elements](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Global+Elements). 

This document describes the details of the example within the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule ESB’s graphical user interface, and includes configuration details for XML Editor where relevant. 

### Example Use Case ###

This application employs Salesforce (OAuth) connector to enable OAuth authentication before performing the integration process. Salesforce is queried to retrieve all contacts from the Salesforce account. To keep it simple, Process Records Phase only prints the contacts to the log. 

### Set Up and Run the Example ###

1. Open the Example project in Anypoint Studio from [Anypoint Exchange](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Anypoint+Exchange). *Do not run the application*.
1. Log in to your Salesforce account. From your account menu (your account is labeled with your name), select **Setup**.
1. In the left navigation bar, under the **Build** heading, click to expand the **Create** folder. 
1. Click **Apps**. Under **Connected Apps** click **New**.
1. Fill in all the required fields. Check *Enable OAuth Settings*. Set Callback URL to *http://localhost:8082/oauth2callback*. Move *Full Access (full)* to Selected OAuth scopes. Click **Save**. Stay on this page.
1. In your application in Studio, click the **Global Elements** tab and add Salesforce (OAuth) connector, if does not already exist.
1. Now, paste the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** in the common.properties file under src/main/resources. ( Another option is to Double-click the Salesforce (OAuth) global element to open its **Global Element Properties** panel. In the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** fields, paste the values from Salesforce App form. Alternatively, configure the global element in the XML Editor. Then click **OK** to save your changes.)
1. In the **Package Explorer**, right-click the *authenticating-salesforce-using-oauth2* project name, then select **Run As > Mule Application**. Studio runs the application on the embedded server.
2. Open your browser and put *http://localhost:8082* in the address bar. You will redirected to Salesforce Login page and asked for your credentials. Allow access for this app.  
3. Go back to Anypoint Studio and the console log should contain lines like these:

		INFO  2014-10-27 12:49:25,779 [[authenticating-salesforce-using-oauth2].connector.http.mule.default.receiver.02] org.mule.examples.LoggerIterator: contact: {LastModifiedDate=2014-08-25T13:21:00.000Z, Id=0032000001INNfoAAH, LastName=Pickwick, type=Contact}

### How it Works ###

The request-response inbound [HTTP endpoint](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Connector) receives requests the end user submits to the Web service. Because it has a request-response message exchange pattern, this HTTP endpoint is responsible for both receiving and returning messages. The [Salesforce Connector](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Salesforce+Connector) is used for both authorization and data retrieval. A query for all contacts is sent to Salesforce instance and later is processed by the custom Java component. 

The following steps outline the process to build this application. 

1. Drop an HTTP Connector to the flow. 
2. Add Salesforce Connector to the flow. Click + sign next to the Connection Configuration. 
3. Select Salesforce (OAuth) from the menu. Fill in Consumer Key and Consumer Secret as explained in the previous section.  
4. Back in Salesforce Connector set Operation to *Authorize* and Display to *PAGE*.
6. Add another Saleforce Connector and choose your Salesforce OAuth Global Connector as Connector Configuration. Set operation to *Query* and Query text to:

		SELECT id,lastname,lastmodifieddate from contact limit 10
6. Add Java component. Specify *org.mule.examples.LoggerIterator* that can be found in the *org.mule.examples* package as Class Name.
8. Add Set Payload component. Set Value to:

		Salesforce query returned #[payload] contacts.
9. The configuration now complete, you can save, then run the application. You should hit the HTTP endpoint and verify that the console log contains lines similar to those listed in **Set Up and Run the Example** section.

 
### Documentation ###

Studio includes a feature that enables you to easily export all the documentation you have recorded for your project. Whenever you want to share your project with others outside the Studio environment, you can export the project's documentation to print, email or share online. Studio's auto-generated documentation includes:

- A visual diagram of the flows in your application
- The XML configuration which corresponds to each flow in your application
- The text you entered in the Notes tab of any building block in your flow

Follow [the procedure](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Importing+and+Exporting+in+Studio#ImportingandExportinginStudio-ExportingStudioDocumentation) to export auto-generated Studio documentation.
